  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to introduce new design-criteria for next-generation hyperparameter optimization software. The criteria we propose include (1) define-by-run API that allows users to construct the parameter search space dynamically, (2) efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies, and (3) easy-to-setup, versatile architecture that can be deployed for various purposes, ranging from scalable distributed computing to light-weight experiment conducted via interactive interface. In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications. Our software is available under the MIT license (https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/).},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} To objectively assess a patient's gait, a robust identification of stride borders is one of the first steps in inertial sensor-based mobile gait analysis pipelines. While many different methods for stride segmentation have been presented in the literature, an out-of-lab evaluation of respective algorithms on free-living gait is still missing. Method:\hspace{0.6em} To address this issue, we present a comprehensive free-living evaluation dataset, including 146.574 semiautomatic labeled strides of 28 Parkinson's Disease patients. This dataset was used to evaluate the segmentation performance of a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based stride segmentation approach compared to an available dynamic time warping (DTW) based method. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The proposed HMM achieved a mean F1-score of 92.1\% and outperformed the DTW approach significantly. Further analysis revealed a dependency of segmentation performance to the number of strides within respective walking bouts. Shorter bouts ({$<\mkern1mu$} 30 strides) resulted in worse performance, which could be related to more heterogeneous gait and an increased diversity of different stride types in short free-living walking bouts. In contrast, the HMM reached F1-scores of more than 96.2\% for longer bouts ({$>\mkern1mu$} 50 strides). Furthermore, we showed that an HMM, which was trained on at-lab data only, could be transferred to a free-living context with a negligible decrease in performance. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} The generalizability of the proposed HMM is a promising feature, as fully labeled free-living training data might not be available for many applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of stride segmentation performance on a large scale free-living dataset. Our proposed HMM-based approach was able to address the increased complexity of free-living gait data, and thus will help to enable a robust assessment of stride parameters in future free-living gait analysis applications.},

  abstract = {We present pomegranate, an open source machine learning package for probabilistic modeling in Python. Probabilistic modeling encompasses a wide range of methods that explicitly describe uncertainty using probability distributions. Three widely used probabilistic models implemented in pomegranate are general mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian networks. A primary focus of pomegranate is to abstract away the complexities of training models from their definition. This allows users to focus on specifying the correct model for their application instead of being limited by their understanding of the underlying algorithms. An aspect of this focus involves the collection of additive sufficient statistics from data sets as a strategy for training models. This approach trivially enables many useful learning strategies, such as out-of-core learning, minibatch learning, and semi-supervised learning, without requiring the user to consider how to partition data or modify the algorithms to handle these tasks themselves. pomegranate is written in Cython to speed up calculations and releases the global interpreter lock to allow for built-in multithreaded parallelism, making it competitive with\textendash or outperform\textendash other implementations of similar algorithms. This paper presents an overview of the design choices in pomegranate, and how they have enabled complex features to be supported by simple code. The code is available at https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, sleep monitoring has been performed in hospital or clinic environments, requiring complex and expensive equipment set-up and expert scoring. Wearable devices increasingly provide a viable alternative for sleep monitoring and are able to collect movement and heart rate (HR) data. In this work, we present a set of algorithms for sleep-wake and sleep-stage classification based upon actigraphy and cardiac sensing amongst 1,743 participants. We devise movement and cardiac features that could be extracted from research-grade wearable sensors and derive models and evaluate their performance in the largest open-access dataset for human sleep science. Our results demonstrated that neural network models outperform traditional machine learning methods and heuristic models for both sleep-wake and sleep-stage classification. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long-short term memory (LSTM) networks were the best performers for sleep-wake and sleep-stage classification, respectively. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) with Random Forest we identified that frequency features from cardiac sensors are critical to sleep-stage classification. Finally, we introduced an ensemble-based approach to sleep-stage classification, which outperformed all other baselines, achieving an accuracy of 78.2\% and F1 score of 69.8\% on the classification task for three sleep stages. Together, this work represents the first systematic multimodal evaluation of sleep-wake and sleep-stage classification in a large, diverse population. Alongside the presentation of an accurate sleep-stage classification approach, the results highlight multimodal wearable sensing approaches as scalable methods for accurate sleep-classification, providing guidance on optimal algorithm deployment for automated sleep assessment.
