# Example data: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database

The data in this folder contains a converted subset of ECG recordings from the publicly available
"MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database".

The full database can be accessed on [Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/) under the 
[Open Data Commons Attribution License v1.0](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/view-license/1.0.0/).

The data here was converted from the original files into csv-files or pickle files to make them easier to read without 
additional tools.

This is example data to show general capabilities of the tcpc library and should not be used as actual test data for any
ECG related algorithms.
Use the original database for that!
