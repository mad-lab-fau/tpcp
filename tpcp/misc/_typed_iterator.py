class BaseTypedIterator(Algorithm, Generic[DataclassT]):
    """A Base class to implement custom typed iterators.

    This class is missing the ``iterate`` method, which needs to be implemented by the child class.
    It has a `_iterate` method though that does most of the heavy lifting.
    The actual iterate method should handle turning the inputs into an iterable and then call `_iterate`.

    :class:`TypedIterator` provides a "dummy" implementation that expects any type of iterator for the iterate method.
    Custom base classes could provide more elaborate preprocessing of the inputs before iteration.
    For example, cutting sections out of a dataframe based on a list of start and end indices, and then iterating over
    the cut sections.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_type
        A dataclass that defines the result type you expect from each iteration.
    aggregations
        An optional list of aggregations to apply to the results.
        This has the form ``[(result_name, aggregation_function), ...]``.
        If a result-name is in the list, the aggregation will be applied to it, when accessing the respective result
        attribute (i.e. ``{result_name}_``).
        If no aggregation is defined for a result, a simple list of all results will be returned.
    NULL_VALUE
        (Class attribute) The value that is used to initialize the result dataclass and will remain in the results, if
        no result was for a specific attribute in one or more iterations.

    Attributes
    ----------
    inputs_
        List of all input elements that were iterated over.
    raw_results_
        List of all results as dataclass instances.
        The attribute of the dataclass instance will have the a value of ``_NOT_SET`` if no result was set.
        To check for this, you can use ``isinstance(val, TypedIterator.NULL_VALUE)``.
    results_
        An instance of the result object with either the "inverted" results (i.e. a list of all results) per attribute
        or the aggregated results (depending on the aggregation function).
        Note, that the typing of the attributes of the result object will not be correct.
    {result_name}_
        The aggregated results for the respective result name.
    done_
        True, if the iterator is done.
        If the iterator is not done, but you try to access the results, a warning will be raised.
