        - The run method must return `self` (or at least an instance of the pipeline)
        - The run method must set result attributes on the pipeline
        - All result attributes must have a trailing `_` in their name
        - The run method must not modify the input parameters of the pipeline

        Parameters
        ----------
        datapoint

        ----------
        datapoint

class OptimizablePipeline(SimplePipeline):

    OptimizablePipelines are expected to implement a concrete way to train internal models or optimize parameters.
    This should not be a reimplementation of GridSearch or similar methods.
    For this :class:`tpcp.pipelines.GridSearch` should be used directly.

    It is important that `self_optimize` only modifies input parameters of the pipeline.
    This means, if a parameter is optimized, by `self_optimize` it should be named in the `__init__` and should be
    exportable when calling `pipeline.get_params`.
    It is also possible to optimize nested parameters.
    For example, if the input of the pipeline is an algorithm or another pipeline on its own, all parameters of these
    objects can be modified as well.
    In any case, you should make sure that all optimized parameters are still there if you call `.clone()` on the
    optimized pipeline.

        Parameters
        ----------

            An instance of a :class:`tpcp.dataset.Dataset` containing one or multiple data points that can
